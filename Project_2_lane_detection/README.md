Problem 1: Video Quality Enhancement
The code file for this problem is problem1.py and can be simply run as follows:\
```>>> python problem1.py```

The enhanced video will be saved in the Code folder as night_ride.mp4.

Problem 2: Lane Detection
This problem has two data sets, data_1 which is a set of images and data_2 which is a video. Both need to be approached
differently, hence we have two python files: lane_detection_1.py and lane_detection_2.py for the respective data sets.
To run any file, there are no extra arguments; simply run the file as :\
```>>> python lane_detection_1.py ```\
```>>> python lane_detection_2.py```

The lane detection will be displayed in a new window and this will be written as a video file and will be saved in the Code folder, under the name video_1.mp4 or video_2.mp4 respectively.
